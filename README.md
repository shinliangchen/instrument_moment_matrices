These Matlab files include computation carried out in https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19548

The folder Toolbox has to be added into the path to run the codes.

DITSR_CHSH.m computes a bound on the temporal steerability given a temporal Bell inequality violation.

SDITSR_CHSH.m does the same as DITSR_CHSH.m, but with an additional dimensional constraint.

max_QRAC_score_2to1.m computes the maximal successful probability in a QRAC 2-->1 scenario.

max_QRAC_score_3to1.m computes the maximal successful probability in a QRAC 3-->1 scenario.

self_testing_QRAC_d2_n2.m computes a lower bound on the fidelity between the reference states and underlying unknown states given an observed QRAC score.
